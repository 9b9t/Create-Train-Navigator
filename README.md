![Logo](https://github.com/MisterJulsen/Create-Train-Navigator/blob/main/logo-256px.png)

Get a list possible train connections in your world from one station to another using the Create Railways Navigator.

## Dependencies
This mod requires the Minecraft [Create Mod v0.5.1e](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/create) or higher for [Minecraft Forge 1.18.2-40.2.0](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.18.2.html) or later.


## Features
This mod adds a new item, the Create Railways Navigator, which is inspired by the [DB Navigator](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/DB_Navigator) (an app in Germany where, among other things, you can get possible train connections). Like this app, the navigator in this mod is intended to suggest possible train connections for trains from the Create Mod in your Minecraft world. Various customization options allow you to specify which track stations should be treated as a single station and how your navigation results should be filtered and sorted so that you always receive the best possible route suggestions.

## Supported Languages
- English (100%)
- German (100%)

## Please note ...
... when using this mod (especially alpha versions) that it can always contain bugs that could potentially damage your world! So please make a backup of your world before embedding this mod.

## Supported Versions
A fabric version of this mod is currently not planned and the mod is mainly ported to newer versions. Please don't ask when the update for version X will come out as I don't know myself. The update will come when I have time for it and it's ready.
